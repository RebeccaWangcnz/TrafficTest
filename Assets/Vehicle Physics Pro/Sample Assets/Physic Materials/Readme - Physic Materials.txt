Vehicle Physics Pro - Physic Materials
--------------------------------------

Use the physics material set that fits the Friction Type setting in Projects Settings > Physics.

Recommended setting is Two Directional Friction Type (more realistic).

You may configure the VPP physic material set for the whole project in:

	Tools > Vehicle Physics > Select Physic Material Set > (choose the physic material set to apply)

Note:
	Properties of the physic materials affect the rigidbody friction and collisions only. Use the
	Ground Materials Manager prefab or component for configuring the material's tire grip and drag.
